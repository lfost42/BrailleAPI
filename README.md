# BrailleSymbols

- .NET REST API that manages a database of ascii braille special symbols as defined by the International Council on English Braille (ICEB) - https://iceb.org/symbsc2.html 
- Role and identity based authentication implemented with Linkedin OAuth 2.0. 
- Designed, tested, and deployed following Open API Specification standards using Swagger.

## PROBLEM IT SOLVES

The special list of symbols are defined by committee and published in html here - https://iceb.org/symbsc2.html; there is no way to search or query the list, yet alone use it for other purposes. This API makes the list accessible and allows developers to use it in braille software. It also opens the opportunity for the community to be involved in keeping the list updated and accurate. 

I plan to consume this as part of a tool that will help transcribers format the Special Symbols Page in Braille transcriptions. It's also a piece of a braille training ecosystem I am designing and hope to build some day.
